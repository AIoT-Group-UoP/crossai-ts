    """Saves a scikit-learn model or pipeline to a .pkl file using joblib.

    This function uses the joblib library to serialize and save scikit-learn
    models or pipelines. It is efficient for models that include large numpy
    arrays.

    Args:
        model: The scikit-learn model or pipeline to be saved. Must be an
               instance of a scikit-learn BaseEstimator or Pipeline.
        filename: The name of the file to save the model to. If the filename
                  does not end with '.pkl', it will be appended automatically.
                  It is recommended to use a meaningful filename that reflects
                  the model type and training characteristics.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return a value. It writes
              the model to a file.

    Example:
    ```python
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load data
    X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

    # Create and fit a model
    model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Save the model to a file
    save_sklearn_model_to_pkl(model, 'iris_model.pkl')
    ```

        ValueError: If the provided model is not an instance of a scikit-learn
                    BaseEstimator or Pipeline.
