    """Constructs a deep neural network based on Xception Architecture meant
        for Time-Series tasks.

    A novel deep learning model referred to as the XceptionTime
    architecture. The proposed innovative XceptionTime is designed by the
    integration of depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive average pooling,
    and a novel non-linear normalization technique. By utilizing the depthwise
    separable convolutions, the XceptionTime network has far fewer parameters
    resulting in a less complex network. The updated architecture in this
    CrossAI topology is extended in such a way as to achieve higher confidence
    in the model’s predictions, it can be adapted to any window size, and its
    upgraded functionalities can avoid overfitting and achieve better model
    generalization.

    Args:
        input_shape: Shape of the input data, excluding the batch size.
        include_top: If true, includes a fully-connected layer at the top of
            the model. Set to False for a custom layer.
        num_classes: Number of classes to predict.
        classifier_activation: Activation function for the classification task.
            Can be a string identifier or a callable function from
                tf.keras.activations.
        xception_adaptive_size: The adaptive size.
        xception_adapt_ws_divide: The number that will divide the adaptive
            size.
        n_filters: An integer that represents the number of filters in the
            convolutional neural network layer.
        drp_low: Fraction of the input units to drop in the input dropout
            layer.
        drp_mid: Fraction of the input units to drop in the mid-dropout layer.
        drp_high: Fraction of the input units to drop in the last dropout
            layer.
        kernel_initialize: The variance scaling initializer. Can be a string
            identifieror a callable function from tf.keras.initializers.
        kernel_regularize: L2 regularization factor; can be a string or float.
            If a string is provided, it's converted to a float.
        kernel_constraint: Max norm constraint for the kernel weights.
        spatial: If true, applies Spatial Dropout, else applies standard
            Dropout.
        mc_inference: If True, enables Monte Carlo dropout during inference.
            Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        model: A Keras Model instance.
