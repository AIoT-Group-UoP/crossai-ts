    This model converts low-level time series features into high-level

    Args:
        input_shape: Shape of the input data, excluding batch size.
        include_top: If True, includes a fully-connected layer at the top.
            Set to False for adding a custom layer.
        num_classes: Number of prediction classes.
        classifier_activation: Activation function for the classification task.
            Can be a string identifier or a function from tf.keras.activations.
        n_layers: Number of Bidirectional LSTM layers.
        lstm_units: LSTM units for each layer.
        dense_units: Units for each dense layer.
        drp_rate: Dropout rate.
        spatial: Type of Dropout. True for SpatialDropout1D, False for regular
            Dropout.
        mc_inference: Dropout setting during inference. True enables,
            False disables, and None means dropout is applied during training
                only.

    Returns:
        A Keras model instance.
